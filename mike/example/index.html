<aside>This is a rough transcript of my talk on June 6, 2013 at <a href="http://eyeofestival.com/">Eyeo</a>. Words and examples have been adapted a bit for the web so may differ slightly from the talk.</aside>

<p>I am a big fan of examples. Not a surprise, right? If you follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/mbostock">Twitter</a>, if you’ve seen my projects over the last few years, if you’ve asked D3 questions on Stack Overflow, you’ve likely seen many of my example visualizations, maps and explanations.

<p>I love examples so much I created a website just for sharing them. <a href="http://bl.ocks.org">Bl.ocks.org</a> is a quick and dirty way to post code and have a live example running permanently with a short URL. The result and the code are displayed adjacently; it’s view source by default. And it’s backed by <a href="https://gist.github.com">GitHub Gist</a>, so your examples have a git repository for version control, and are forkable, cloneable and commentable.

<p>Initially I thought I’d just show all my examples. But with more than 600 examples, I calculated I’d have 4.5 seconds per. And (Ignite talks notwithstanding) I fear that would be a bit overwhelming. So instead I’ve picked a few favorites that I hope you enjoy. You should find this talk entertaining, even if it fails to be insightful.

<p>But this talk does has a point. Examples are lightweight and informal. They can be made in as little as fifteen minutes. They lack the ceremony of polished graphics or official tools. Yet they are a powerful medium of communication, capable of expressing big ideas with immediate impact. Eyeo is a unique opportunity for me to talk directly to all of you that are doing amazing things with code, data and visualization. So, <b>if I can accomplish one thing with my talk, it should be to get you to share more examples.</b> In short, to share my love of examples with you.

<h2><a href="#1" name="1">#</a>The Flawed Example</h2>

<p>So let’s start with an example, shall we? This is one of my favorite examples, but it is also flawed in a way that is representative of many, making it a good candidate for dissection.
